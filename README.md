# customer_behavior_analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Data Analytics workflow**, from loading and understanding raw data to generating business insights and presenting them through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The project covers:

* Data loading and exploration using Python
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* SQL analysis using PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

## Dataset

The project uses a structured dataset containing relevant business/analytical information.

The dataset was:

1. Loaded into Python for initial exploration
2. Checked for missing values and duplicates
3. Cleaned and transformed where required
4. Used for SQL-based analysis
5. Connected to Power BI for visualization

**Dataset:** `dataset.csv`
*(Replace this with your actual dataset name or source.)*

## Project Steps

### 1. Load Dataset

The dataset was imported into Python using Pandas and inspected to understand its structure, columns, data types, and overall size.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was performed to identify patterns, trends, relationships, and potential issues in the dataset.

Key activities included:

* Understanding dataset dimensions
* Checking data types
* Descriptive statistics
* Missing-value analysis
* Duplicate-value analysis
* Outlier identification
* Distribution analysis
* Correlation analysis
* Data visualization

### 3. Data Cleaning

The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis.

Major cleaning activities included:

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicate records
* Correcting data types
* Standardizing inconsistent values
* Handling invalid records
* Renaming columns where required
* Preparing the final dataset for SQL and Power BI

### 4. SQL Analysis

The cleaned dataset was imported into **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server**.

SQL queries were used to answer analytical and business questions.

The analysis included:

* Filtering and sorting
* Aggregations
* `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
* `JOIN` operations
* Subqueries
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window functions
* Ranking and trend analysis

SQL queries are available in:

`sql/`

### 5. Power BI Dashboard

The analyzed data was used to create an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The dashboard includes:

* KPI cards
* Charts and graphs
* Category-wise analysis
* Trend analysis
* Filters and slicers
* Interactive visualizations
* Key business metrics
